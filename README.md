## About

### Description and Purpose

Reminder Remorse is your typical reminders app with a twist. It charges you when you miss a reminder and sends the money to a charity or a friend. This app is designed to help you stay on top of your tasks and help others in the process.

### Inspiration

We were frustrated with the normal reminders app we all have on our phones. While it is useful, it is not very motivating. With goals a big part of our lives, we wanted an app that could be so much more. That's how Reminder Remorse came to life.
